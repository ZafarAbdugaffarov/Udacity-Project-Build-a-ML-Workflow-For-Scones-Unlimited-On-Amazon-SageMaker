\section{Overview}

This project builds a machine learning workflow for Scones Unlimited using Amazon SageMaker. It involves deploying and monitoring an image classification model using the CIFAR-100 dataset.

\section{Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing:} Clean, transform, and prepare the CIFAR-100 dataset.
  \item \textbf{Model Training:} Train an image classification model using Amazon SageMaker.
  \item \textbf{Deployment:} Deploy the trained model as an endpoint using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
  \item \textbf{Monitoring:} Set up monitoring for the deployed endpoint to track model performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technologies Used}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Amazon SageMaker: Model training and deployment.
  \item AWS Lambda: Invokes the SageMaker endpoint for inference.
  \item Amazon API Gateway: Provides a RESTful API to access the model.
  \item Git: Version control for project files.
  \item Linux Terminal: Command-line operations and project management.
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation}
