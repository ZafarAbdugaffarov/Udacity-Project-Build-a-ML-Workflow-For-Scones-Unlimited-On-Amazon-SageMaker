# Udacity Project: Build a Machine Learning Workflow for Scones Unlimited on Amazon SageMaker

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning workflow for Scones Unlimited using Amazon SageMaker. It involves deploying and monitoring an image classification model using a sample CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning, transformation, and preparation of the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes Amazon SageMaker for training the image classification model.
- **Deployment:** Deploys the trained model as an endpoint using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
- **Monitoring:** Sets up monitoring for the deployed endpoint to track model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Amazon SageMaker
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- Git
- Linux Terminal
